# this contains every known leak of coffeeware.

so padero (shidemuri on github, they also have a newer version leaked but i prefer this one) had their script cracked by sang, furthermore starting the downfall of what was coffeeware. sang helped by cracking, moon helped by social engineering padero into leaking the workings of the whitelist system, i helped by leaking pretty much every part of the script (unobfuscated).

that's what happens when you skid everything and resell it :)
